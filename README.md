# map-compare

This project provides a small static website that lets you compare two places of the world side by side. The maps are powered by Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles by default but can be switched to satellite imagery. The interface is responsive so it works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Usage

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or host the repository with any static hosting solution such as GitHub Pages. The URL keeps the current map positions so copyâ€‘pasting the address bar will restore the same views.
It also stores whether map or satellite tiles are selected. Map labels follow your browser language by default; append `?lang=en` to force English names.

Each shape has a blue drag handle at its center so you can reposition it at any time. The handle is always visible and works independently on each map. Shapes represent actual surface area so they grow or shrink as you zoom in or out. Once drawn a shape can't be edited, so redraw it if needed.
When a new shape is created on the first map it is automatically duplicated on the second map at that map's current center so both panes show the drawing immediately. The duplicate is scaled to compensate for the Mercator projection's area distortion so you can compare actual surface areas at different latitudes. Use the trash button in the toolbar to delete individual shapes. The marker tool has been removed so only polygons, polylines and rectangles may be drawn.
