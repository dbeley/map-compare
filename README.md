# map-compare

This project provides a small static website that lets you compare two places of the world side by side. The maps are powered by Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles by default but can be switched to satellite imagery. The interface is responsive so it works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Usage

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or host the repository with any static hosting solution such as GitHub Pages. The URL keeps the current map positions so copyâ€‘pasting the address bar will restore the same views.
It also stores whether map or satellite tiles are selected.
