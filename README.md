# map-compare

This project provides a small static website that helps comparing two places of the world side by side. The maps are powered by Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles.

## Usage

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or host the repository with any static hosting solution such as GitHub Pages. The URL keeps the current map positions so copyâ€‘pasting the address bar will restore the same views.
